## What it does
The script is executed on the "aunicalogin" page: https://aunicalogin.polimi.it/aunicalogin/aunicalogin.jsp
It checks whether the person code and password boxes have been autofilled and, in case they are, it clicks the submit button.

The "stay logged in" checkbox is also checked before logging in.
